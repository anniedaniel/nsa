        <h2>The NSA: A Global Perspective</h1>
          <hr />
          <p>On June 5, 2013, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order">The Guardian</a> and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/">The Washington Post</a> with the help of Edward Snowden revealed the leaked classified documents from the NSA outlining their collection of millions of Verison customers' data. Since then, this story has grown into an international phenomonon that has taken the globe by storm.</p>

        <p>To some, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance">Edward Snowden</a> is a traitor revealing already accepted American secrets to the world. To others, Snowden is am American hero whistelblowing on an overreaching and invasive government agency.</p>
        <p>Regardless of anyone's feelings toward Snowden, the following of the NSA revelations has exploded into an international outcry forcing the world to reevaluate their surveillance and security strategies to protect their own national secets.</p>
        <p>Here, we'll take a look at how this story has spread around the world, and what the rest of the word is saying. I will focus on the events after the story broke on June 2013 and discuss what the story and the NSA's activities mean for future legislation.</p>

        After 9/11, the NSA/CSS had been exposed for their tapping into phonecalls suspected to have been with foreign correspondents (Wong, 2006). What makes the most recent revelations so suspicious is the demand of Verison, a private corporation, to disclose their private records of their customers to a government agency. In addition, prior to the leaks provided by Snowden, all NSA information was classified creating a difficult environemt for policy makers and adacemics to research the legality and general practices of the NSA (Lee, 2006 p.2). This brings numerous questions to the surface regardung civilian privacy and who has control over our data and for what reasons.

        As a result, the NSA and their surveillance protocols have been under suspicion from various international institutions for nearly a decade. Questions of the legality of such survellance measures have been discussed since the Patriot Act of the Bush Administration (Lee, 2006). For this investigation, however, I will focus on the international developments since June 5, 2013.

    <h3>What Happened Next</h3>
    <p>After the initial Verison story broke at The Guardian and The Washington Post, the outcry immediately set off a global manhunt to track down the person who revealed the classified documents. On June 9, 2013 Edward Snowden <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance">revealed himself</a> in an interview with reporters from The Guardian from his hotel room in Hong Kong. The fast that this story was broken by an international publication while Snowden was abroad sets the stage to allow all eyes of the world to know what exactly Edward Snowden and The Guardian as well as other news publications have to reveal about the American NSA. As Snowden's welcome in Hong Kong ran out, he fled to Moscow where he camped out in the airport for over a month. After applying for asylum in over twenty countries, Snowden was finally granted a visa in Moscow where he is now living.</p>
    <p>For the U.S. Federal Government, the situation was uncomfortable to say the least. When the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data">PRISM</a> story unfolded the next day, the international community was up in arms at how the U.S. government chose to handle the controversy. To appease the American citizens concerned about their private information, the federal government argued that PRISM wasn't about them- it was about <i>everyone</i> else- even American allies. This caused some ruffled feathers among America's European friends, and suddenly, everyone was on edge. Meanwhile, these details came out just as President Obama was preparing to atttend his first summit with Xi Jinping, the new Chinese leader and talk about keeping a "self-appointed moral high ground on cyber security." (Dempsey, 2013).</p>
